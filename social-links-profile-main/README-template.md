## Overview

Overall the challenege proved to be perfect for increasing my workflow and knowledge.

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

## My process

1. Analyzed read.me and supplied project pics to get a grasp of how best to approach the project
  -Also reviewed all syntax that was already present in project
2. HTML, structured website 
  -Implemented any needed boiler plate HTML in <head> section
    -link css file to html
  -I like to include comments above every div to roughly explain what I’m doing, or plan to do with the section 
3. CSS, work from top to bottom, only moving forward when I’m content with the section
  -test any third party font and include back-up fonts like sans-serif
4. Final tweaks
  -this is really about making sure the final product feels concise
    -delete empty spaces, and unneeded code, make sure code looks organized
5. Complete a README.md
  -this really helps absorb everything you learned 
  -helps other developers 
  -helps mentors see where improvements could be made 
6. Github
  -create a github page of the project
  -once established, include a link to the github page in your project README.md file
  -then stage -> commit -> push to github repository 
  -make sure link works 
7. Celebrate
  -coding can be challenging, it’s important to celebrate and be proud of your progress
8. Think about what’s the best move forward in your developer path.
  -there is always more to learn and practice. It’s important to have a grasp of where your time is best spent in relation to your coding goals 
 

### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS 
  - Flexbox
  - CSS Grid


### What I learned

1. It was my original goal to apply what I learned in grid, to make the link div section of this project. It didn't go as plan. I ended up using flexbox in the end. I learned some weakpoints in my grid knowledge 
2. Adding padding on one side of a element, can ruin a perfect shaped circle
    -In contrast, adding margin on one side of a element, will not affect circle shape


### Continued development

1. Moving forward I would like to use this project as a template to make my own social link page. I plan to change the buttoms to real working links. 
2. Reviewing the challenge again as I create this README.md, I see I was suppose to include a focus state with the link buttons
  -I will include this challenge when creating my own personal social link profile page
